# Unit testing exercise

Hello people!
In this repository you will find a function called `fizzBuzz` in `unit-test-exercise.js`.

### What the `fizzBuzz` function does:

1. It takes a number as input;
2. If that number is divisible by three, it returns the text “Fizz”;
3. if that number is divisible by five, it returns the text "Buzz";
4. If that number is divisible by **both** three and five, it returns "FizzBuzz";
5. If none of those cases apply, it returns the number itself.

The `fizzBuzz` function is the solution to a simplified version of **_The FizzBuzz problem_**, which is a common interview question.

## Important!

**Please do not modify the `fizzBuzz` function!**
I promise it's doing its job, so let's not disturb it.

## What you need to do for this exercise

Your job is to write unit tests for the `fizzBuzz` function.
These unit tests are just regular functions which verify that `fizzBuzz` behaves as expected.

1. Open `unit-test-exercise.js`;
2. Find the commented line that says "Write your tests below this line";
3. Write your tests underneath.

Consider what the function is doing and write as many tests as you can to verify that it is doing its job.
I have pre-written one test to give you some inspiration.

## Tips for writing a good unit test

1. Spend a few minutes to decide your **test cases**: what are you trying to verify?
2. Give your tests descriptive names! It's okay to use ridiculously long names in this case.
3. One test should only deal with one single test case at a time.
